# COS 285 - Data Structures Lab 4
The lab had us use GitHub to collaborate on a binary tree method code. We implemented two methods, one to perform a breadth first search and prints each node in the order that they are encountered and a method to search the tree for a target and returns either true if it exists or false if it does not exist in the tree. We belive that this lab went well considering all of the GitHub issues we encountered. We used lecture 9 slides to help write the bfsPrintTree method. The search method uses a helper method to recursively search for a target element.
